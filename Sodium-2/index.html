                <p class="left">A. Defining Photosynthesis</p>
                <p>Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and certain other organisms transform light energy into chemical energy.</p>
                <p class="left">B. Process of Photosynthesis</p>
                <p class="jus">
                  a. Energies and Process: Plants undergo photosynthesis by capturing light energy and using it to absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) from the atmosphere and soil, respectively. Inside the plant cells, water undergoes oxidation, which involves the loss of electrons, while carbon dioxide undergoes reduction, which involves the gain of electrons. As a result, water converts into oxygen, and carbon dioxide transforms into glucose. The plant then exhales the oxygen into the air and reserves the energy in the glucose molecules. <br><br>

                  b. Calvin cycle: In the Calvin Cycle, carbon atoms from CO2 are fixed and used to build three-carbon sugars. This process is fueled by and dependent on ATP and NADPH from the light reactions. The reactions of the Calvin cycle take place in the stroma (the inner space of chloroplasts).
                </p>
                <p class="left">C. Types of Photosynthesis</p>
                <p class="jus">
                  a. C3: Used by the majority of plants, it involves producing a three-carbon compound called 3-phosphoglyceric acid during the Calvin Cycle, which goes on to become a sugar called glucose. <br><br>
                  b. C4: he process produces a four-carbon intermediate compound, which splits into carbon dioxide and a three-carbon compound during the Calvin Cycle. A benefit of C4 photosynthesis is that, by producing higher levels of carbon, it allows plants to thrive in environments without much light or water. <br><br>
                  c. CAM: Instead of separating the light-dependent reactions and the use of CO2 ​in the Calvin cycle in space, CAM plants separate these processes in time. Plant species that use CAM photosynthesis not only avoid photorespiration but are also very water-efficient. Their stomata only open at night, when humidity tends to be higher, and temperatures are cooler, both factors that reduce water loss from leaves. CAM plants are typically dominant in very hot, dry areas like deserts.

                The contributing factor of climate change in plants is extreme heat stress, which limits plant growth and development. The decrease in photosynthetic rate negatively impacts plant development in heat and water stress, such as lowered internal plant CO2, inhibition of photosynthetic enzymes (e.g., Rubisco), and synthesis of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which produces chemical energy that is needed for regulating plant biochemical reactions. Individual stress is much more tolerable than heat stress dealt in the intensity, duration, and rate of increase in temperature. An increase in soil temperature declines soil water content. <br><br>
                The production of crops decreased rapidly, and by 2030, climate change may take over this effect. High greenhouse emissions cause major declines in crops such as corn by 24% and wheat by 17%. This change is a sudden approach when it comes to climate change. Thus, scientists are involved in climate model simulations. Temperature is a huge factor when it comes to the simulation of these crops, according to the scientists. “Higher levels of CO2 in the atmosphere have a positive effect on photosynthesis and water retention, increasing crop yields.” With rising global temperatures, rainfall patterns, and frequency of heat waves affecting the crops, the climate simulation works in knowing the plant’s progress, how it works within the hot and dry conditions, and knowing what certain outcomes of these plants will decline productivity by the following years.

                The research aims to address the challenges of climate change in agriculture by developing climate-smart crops that can withstand the changing weather patterns caused by global warming. The scientists used a combination of genetic engineering and computational modeling to create maize plants that are more resilient to heat stress and can maintain high yields under drought conditions. The study shows that the engineered maize plants can survive longer in high temperatures than traditional maize plants, thanks to the introduction of heat-tolerant genes. The crops were also able to maintain high yields under drought conditions, which is a common problem in areas affected by climate change. The researchers found that the new crops use water more efficiently and maintain photosynthesis even in stressful conditions. The study also demonstrated the effectiveness of using computational models to predict how crops will perform under different climate scenarios. The models were able to accurately predict the performance of the engineered maize plants in different climatic conditions, showing the potential of using this approach to develop more climate-resilient crops. <br><br>
                The researchers focused on improving the photosynthetic efficiency of C3 crops such as rice, wheat, and soybeans, which are the most widely grown crops in the world. They achieved this by introducing a synthetic protein called Rubisco Activase that helps to increase the activity of RuBisCo, an enzyme responsible for capturing carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. By doing so, the researchers were able to increase the yield of the C3 crops by up to 40%. The researchers also worked on developing C4 photosynthesis in crops such as rice, which is a C3 plant. C4 photosynthesis is a more efficient form of photosynthesis that evolved in plants in response to high temperatures and dry conditions. The researchers introduced a set of genes from a C4 plant into rice, which led to the development of a C4-like photosynthetic pathway in rice. The engineered rice plants showed a 50% increase in photosynthetic efficiency compared to unmodified rice plants. <br><br>
                Overall, the research shows promise in developing crops that can adapt to the changing climate and provide a solution to food security concerns. The study also highlights the importance of using advanced technologies such as genetic engineering and computational modeling to address the challenges posed by climate change in agriculture.

                  <p class="jus">
                    Chlorophyll molecules in plant cells absorb light energy and use it in order to stimulate electrons. The stimulated electron can then be transferred to other molecules in a series of redox reactions, ultimately leading to the production of ATP and NADPH, which are energy-rich molecules that are used to power the synthesis of carbohydrates.

                    Quantum efficiency is the ratio of absorbed photons to photons used in photosynthesis. It's determined by the laws of quantum mechanics and represents how effectively plants convert absorbed photons of light into chemical energy.
